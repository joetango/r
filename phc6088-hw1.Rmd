## 1.

Answer: B, BbCc

If the black agouti parent had BB, all of the offspring would be black coat as B (black agouti coat) is dominant to b (brown agouti coat), per the instructions. This rules out A and E. Because the albino mouse has genotype bbcc, there will be at least one c in the genotype of the black agouti parent, which rules out C and D. This leaves us with option B, BbCc.
