```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)

data(NHANES)

```

2. 

```{r}

NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = BMI, y = TotChol)) +
  geom_point()

```

3. Setting the color in the aesthetic here does not change the color of the geom_point layer, but it is trying to stratify the data points in the plot by a string, "blue" in this case, which is why we see the "blue" in the legend. 
```{r}

ggplot(data = NHANES) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Height, y = Weight, color = "blue"))

```

4. I am unable to map a continuous variable to shape 

```{r}

NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight, color = Poverty, size = Poverty, shape = Education)) +
  geom_point()

NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight, shape = Education)) +
  geom_point()

```
